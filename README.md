# Financial-Analysis-using-SQL-Power-BI

The main objective of this project was to clean and analyze financial data using SQL techniques and to gain hands-on experience with Power BI for data visualization. An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted in SQL prior to importing the data into Power BI to identify key insights for visualization.

The financial data used for this project was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaarya25/financials/data?select=Financials.csv

2. Profit Analysis
- Profit and profit margin calculations
- Identification of the region/country with the highest profit margins
